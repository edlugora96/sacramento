              <h3>The San Francisco Neighborhood of Presidio Heights</h3>
              <h4>Inside Perspective</h4>
              <p>
                Presidio Heights is Pacific Heights without the pretension.
                While some of the grandest homes in the city are found in this
                neighborhood, including the cluster of mansions circled around
                the gated enclave of Presidio Terrace, Presidio Heights is very
                much a family-friendly community. You can find families with
                young kids picnicking in the Presidio or romping through the
                nearby Julius Kahn Playground. Browse our selection of Presidio
                Heights homes for sale.

                The older, established homes along the wide, quiet streets of
                Presidio Heights are mainly two-story, large, and complete with
                front and back yards. This is a primarily residential
                neighborhood, with nearby shopping to be found in the adjoining
                Laurel District.

                This is an ecumenical neighborhood. The stately dome of Temple
                Emanu-El, the Jewish synagogue is just around the corner from
                the Little Sisters of the Poor on Lake Street. Farther down
                California Street in Laurel Heights, the Jewish Community Center
                of San Francisco welcomes all to its first-rate health club and
                nightly performance series of dance, music, and theater. Across
                the street, Ella's is much loved for its unpretentious comfort
                food and weekend brunch. Upscale restaurants clustered on
                Sacramento Street include Spruce and Sociale. The intimate G
                Bar, oozing with ambiance, makes a great place to meet for
                martinis.
